          <h1>Python</h1>
          <p> While teaching math and physics I made a lot of animations using Python to
            illustrate concepts. When time permits maybe I'll dust them off and upload them here. </p>
          <h3>CAT</h3>
          <p> I have been sceptical about using a mouse after a mouse related injury back in 1988
            and in 1995 I dreamed up an alternative, CAT (Cross Aiming Tool). I made some
            mock-ups, but I wasn't a good enough programmer to make an actual CAT until
            recently. I'm not using it myself, partly because I'm using dual screens
            these days and partly because I have grown used to using a mouse. </p>
          <a href="https://github.com/HappyDustbunny/cat_python"> The code for CAT
            can be found on Github </a>
          <p> I learned a lot about windows management during the project. Among other
            things that transparent windows are tough for most languages. Even Pythons
            Tcl can only manage semi-transparency. </p>

          <h3>Games</h3>
          <p> Toke (my youngest) and I made a couple of games while leaning to program in Python. </p>
          <p> <a href="https://github.com/HappyDustbunny/Caterpillar">Caterpillar</a> is a
            &34frac; finished game involving a caterpillar moving between planets, landing
            on planets and eating coloured blocks. Basically an attempt on a 3D Snake clone. </p>
          <p> Another game was <a href="https://github.com/HappyDustbunny/two_player_tetris">Two
            Player Tetris</a> where two players cooperate to complete lines on a Tetris board. </p>
          <br>
          <p> A third game was <a href="https://github.com/etok414/BlockJoin">BlockJoin</a>, an
            attempt to merge a 3D Tetris with Shokoban. </p>
          <br>
          <p> I have always disliked the way calendars are organised: Time is linear to me,
            not zig-zaggy like a normal month view.
            <a href="https://github.com/HappyDustbunny/timer_machine">Timer Machine</a> is an
            atttempt to make a 3D layout for calendars. Maybe I'll play more with the concept
            some day. I still like the look. Trouble is that the 3D package I used isn't too hot on
            big chunks of text. Maybe HTML5 can be bullied into doing something along these lines. </p>
