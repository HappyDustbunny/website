          <h3>My journey into programming</h3>
          <p> I started programming on a TI 68 and continued on my brothers ZX Spectrum
            and my highschools Piccoline computers running Comal 80.</p>
          <p>At university I used Fortran 77, a hideous language with a malign sense of humor:
            "You have an error. Between line 200 and 500. Good luck finding it."</p>
          <p>Around 1995 I looked into HTMl and in 1998 I had to learn Visual Basic in
            order to theach programming at HTX. I was a few weeks more experienced than my pupils. Fun times.</p>
          <p> Around 2000 I was introduced to Python and used it for writing small programs
            illustrating the physics I taught in highschool. The introduction of Python 3
            threw me off for a few years</p>
          <p>My youngest and school proved incompatible and after teaching them A level
            math we swithed to programming around 2017. Pyton at first and later Rust.
            After the first couple of month I was again in the situation of being only a
            little more experience, but now my advantage was down to hours: anything
            I grasped Toke took and run with immediatly. I learned <em>a lot.</em> </p>
          <p> After Toke started school again I looked into HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I
            started making a planning tool in order to have a project and it kind of
            got it's own life. After 1&half; year I am still not finished. Making the
            whole thing in vanilla JS may not be the wisest decision, but I learned
            a lot by making everything from scratch.</p>
