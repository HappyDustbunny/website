          <h1>Rust</h1>
            <p> After about one and a half year of Python Toke thought we ought to move on.</p>
            <p> I looked around and found that Rust was up and comming, so we bought the book
              "Programming Rust" by Blandy and Orendorff. </p>
            <p> I read the book and explained the concepts to Toke, who went on to use
              them and show me how to think about Rust. A very exiting and challenging time! </p>
            <h3>N body</h3>
            <p> After making some exercises from the book we set out to try Rust's number
              crunhing abilities. </p>
                <p> When I studied astronomy back in the late 1980ties simulations
              of star clusters were all the rage on supercomuters. I figured a modern gamer
              was a match for an old super computer and my hunch turned out to be right :-) </p>
            <p> After som simplifying assumptions and tricks (See this note for details:
              <a href="../programming/nBodyTheory.pdf">N body Theory</a>) we made a simulation.</p>
            <p> I took care of the graphics using the Nannou package and Toke programmed the
              heavy lifting recoursive stuff.</p>
            <p> By borrowing some code from the Mandelbrot example in the "Programming Rust" book
              we obtained multi threading and a speed boost of 8 times. It was amazing to watch
              the computer being able to run such heavy simulations. </p>
