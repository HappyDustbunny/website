          <h1>Rust</h1>
            <p> After about one and a half year of Python Toke thought we ought to move on.</p>
            <p> I looked around and found that Rust was up and comming, so we bought the book
              "Programming Rust" by Blandy and Orendorff. </p>
            <p> I read the book and explained the concepts to Toke, who went on to use
              them and show me how to think about Rust. A very exiting and challenging time! </p>
            <h3>N body</h3>
            <p> After making some exercises from the book we set out to try Rust's number
              crunhing abilities. </p>
                <p> When I studied astronomy back in the late 1980ties simulations
              of star clusters were all the rage on supercomputers. I figured a modern gamer
              was a match for an old super computer and my hunch turned out to be right :-) </p>
            <p> After som simplifying assumptions and tricks (See this note for details:
              <a href="../programming/nBodyTheory.pdf">N body Theory</a>) we made a simulation.</p>
            <p> I took care of the graphics using the Nannou package and Toke programmed the
              heavy lifting recoursive stuff.</p>
            <p> By borrowing some code from the Mandelbrot example in the "Programming Rust" book
              we obtained multi threading and a speed boost of 8 times. It was amazing to watch
              the computer being able to run such heavy simulations. </p>

            <p> <a href="https://github.com/HappyDustbunny/n_body"> The code for the simulation</a>
              can be found on my Github page.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Simple neural net</h3>
            <p> After N-body we took a look at neural nets. </p>
            <p> I read the theory and made a <a href="../programming/Simple_Neural_Net.ods">
              spreadsheet emulating the simplest possible neural net with three neurons
            </a>: an input neuron, an output neuron and a single hidden layer consisting
            of one neuron.</p>
            <p> I also wrote <a href="../programming/Back_propagation.pdf">a note
              about simple back propagation</a> about a six neuron network with one
              hidden layer of two neurons. The math looks horrendous because I include
              every painstaikning detail, but it is actually fairly simple, using
              nothing but high school math.</p>
            <a href="../programming/Back_propagation.pdf">
              <img src="../images/backpropagation_note_first_page.jpg" width="200px" height="276x" alt="Screenshot of first page of note about back propagation.">
            </a>
            <p> Then we made a neural net with two hidden layers of 8 neurons each capable
              of showing 4 bit binary numbers on a (2+)7 segment display. </p>
            <video loop src="../images/bin_to_7_seg.webm" autoplay>
              Short video showing a neural net with two hidden layers being trained showing 4 bit binary numbers on a 7 segment display
            </video>
            <p> Again I made the support structure and the graphics while Toke did the
              main programming of the back propagation. <a href="https://github.com/etok414/simple_nn">The code for the simple neural net</a> is on Toke's Github page.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Handwritten number recognition</h3>
            <p> After this simple example we set out to make a neural net capable of recognizing
              handwritten numbers. We got the training data from <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">Yann Lecun</a> and was inspired
              by the YouTube video about <a href="https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk">neural networks by YouTuber 3Blue1Brown</a>.</p>
            <p> The <a href="https://github.com/etok414/numbers_nn"> handwriting recognition code</a> is on Toke's Github.</p>
