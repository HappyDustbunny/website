          <h1>Introduction to the Git command line</h1>
          <p> After using Github for a couple of years, I only had a rudimentary
            idea about the whole thing. </p>
      		<p> The tutorials were too long and the names too confusing for me to put
            in the effort to really learn Git. </p>
      		<p> This is an attempt to write the guide I wished I&rsquo;ve found some
            years ago. And (maybe mostly) to remind myself what to do when I forget :-P </p>
      		<p> For installation and motivation, look somewhere else. </p>

      		<h3> Tools </h3>
          <p> The command line is all you need &ndash; and it is less confusing
            for beginners in my opinion. </p>
      		<p> On Windows you can use the native command line, but with the Git installation
            comes a Linux-like command line called <em>Git Bash</em>. I prefer the power of
            Linux, but it&rsquo;s a matter of taste. </p>
      		<p> A simple thing like being able to clear the window by typing <kbd>clear</kbd> is nice though, and
      		Windows lacks the powerful tool <kbd>grep</kbd> that can search for anything and take regex-expressions. </p>

      		<h3>
      			Getting started
      		</h3>
      		<p> Once you are in your new project folder (<kbd>mkdir proj,</kbd>
            <kbd> cd proj</kbd>) you can ask Git to track your work by typing <kbd>git init</kbd>.
      		  This will make a <em>.git</em> folder you don&rsquo;t need to interact with. </p>
      		<p> Your local repository lives in the <em>.git</em> folder and contains a copy of
            the entire project throughout it&rsquo;s history. Often it is a good idea
            with a <em>.gitignore</em> file to tell Git which files not to track. </p>
      		<p> If you set up a virtual environment it will often have a relevant <em>.gitignore </em>file. </p>
      		<p> There are lot of resources on the web that can help build a <em>.gitignore </em>or teach you about
      			syntax if you want to exclude stuff manually. </p>
      		<p><strong>Note:</strong> You&rsquo;ll need to ask the file explorer to
            <em>Show All Files</em> to see files preceded by a dot like .git, or use the
            command <em>ls -a</em> in Git Bash. </p>

          <h3>Using Git</h3>
      		<p> Now you make changes in your project and want Git to save a snapshot. </p>

      		<p> The command <kbd>git status</kbd> will show you if there are changes or not.
            If there are, add the files worthy of being tracked by typing <kbd>git add &lt;filename&gt;</kbd>
            or - as everything most likely should be tracked - add all by typing <kbd>git add .</kbd>
            (The period tells Git to include <em>all</em> changed files).</p>
      		<p> To actual start tracking the files, type <kbd>git commit -m &ldquo;Some
            description of the changes&rdquo;</kbd>. </p>
      		<p> Omit the <kbd>-m</kbd> flag if your commit message needs to be more than a sentence. You
      		  will then be taken to an editor to compose the message. </p>
      		<p> Typically you will want to <em>push</em> your work to Github or
      			another remote repository by <kbd>git push</kbd> after a commit. </p>
      		<p> You can see your previous commits by typing <kbd>git log </kbd>(press
            <kbd>q</kbd> to exit), though you often will want to format the output by using
            one or more of these flags <kbd>--oneline</kbd> <kbd>--graph</kbd> <kbd> --7</kbd>. </p>
      		<p>
      			<kbd>git reflog</kbd> gives similar information, but with information about <kbd>head</kbd> status and
      			commit/merge actions rather than commit messages.
      		</p>

      		<p>In Git Bash you can nickname the combination you like the most by making an alias:
      			<kbd>alias graph=&rdquo;git log --oneline --graph  -7&rdquo;</kbd>. This will let <kbd>graph</kbd>
      		have the same effect as typing <kbd>git log --oneline --graph  --7</kbd>.
      		To make aliases permanent you&rsquo;ll have to write them to the file <em>C:\Program Files\Git\etc\profile.d\aliases</em>
      		(for Windows 10). You may have to change permissions for the file and delete the file <em>.bashrc</em>
      		in your home directory (<em>~/.bashrc</em>).
      		</p>

      		<p> Another good alias is <kbd>alias la=&rsquo;ls -a&rsquo;</kbd>, </p>

      		<p> After having committed a few changes you can return to your earlier work by typing
             <kbd>git checkout 26a47c1</kbd> where the number is the first 7 digits in the
             long number denoting each commit. </p>
      		<p> If you are using the <kbd>--oneline</kbd> flag only 7 digits will be displayed. </p>

      		<p> To get back to the most recent work type <kbd>git checkout master</kbd>. Try jumping
            back and forth while having you work open in an adjacent window. <br>
            (Note that <em>master</em> is the old term for the main branch. In the future <em>main</em>
            or <em>trunk</em> will denote the main branch. Only masochists wants a master...)</p>

      		<p> To drop work on one machine before pulling newer work from another machine stash your
             work (save your work like putting it on a shelve for a later that never comes) by
             <kbd>git stash</kbd> and then type <kbd>git checkout master </kbd>to go back to
             the version right after the last local commit. </p>
      		<p> The stash can be removed by <kbd>git stash pop</kbd>, but will <em>not</em> be
            recoverable. Lookup <em>git stash</em> on the internet for safer ways to deal with
            stashes like <kbd>git stash apply</kbd>. </p>
      		<p> The commands <kbd>git reset</kbd> and <kbd>git revert</kbd> gives yet more
            flexibility to clean up if you mess up. </p>

      		<h3>Branches</h3>
      		<p> If you change something in your old work you will not be able to commit or save,
            because this would conflict with later work or rewrite history. In the graph you
            will note that the label HEAD shows where you are. Jumping
      			back will leave you with <em>&ldquo;a detached head&rdquo;</em>. </p>
      		<p> To be able to work on your old work you&rsquo;ll need to make a branch:
            <kbd>git branch &lt;newbranchname&gt;</kbd>.</p>
      		<p> This will photocopy all your old work to another branch where you can work as normal. </p>
    			<p> You can jump between branches with checkout: <kbd>git checkout master</kbd>
            and <kbd>git checkout &lt;newbranchname&gt;</kbd>. </p>
    			<p> Normally branches is made to try something out without ruining <em>master</em>.
      			<br>
      			You can do this yourself or someone you collaborate with can branch out.
            <br>
            Brances that work out is then merged back into <em>master.</em> </p>
    			<p>To make Github track a locally created branch write
            <kbd>git push --set-upstream origin &lt;MyLocalBranch&gt;</kbd> </p>

      		<h3>Merging</h3>
      		<p> When you are satisfied with the branch you merge it back into <em>master</em>
            by checking out <em>master</em> and type <kbd>git merge </kbd><kbd>&lt;branchname&gt;</kbd>.
            Basically the changes in the document(s) in the branch is inserted in the relevant
            documents at <em>master</em>, even if there has been work done on <em>master</em>. </p>

      		<p>If the same lines has been tampered with in both documents, there will be a merge
      		conflict that you will need to resolve manually. </p>

      		<p> There is a lot of tools to compare the text and choose what to keep, but it is possible
      			to edit the documents in a simple editor and just remove the unwanted text
            and the &lt;&lt;, == and &gt;&gt; by hand. </p>
      		<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
      		<p>Master&rsquo;s
      		text</p>
      		<p>====================</p>
      		<p>Branch&rsquo;s
      		text</p>
      		<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
      		<p> After a merge conflict is resolved (or dropped by <kbd>git merge --abort</kbd>) the
            relevant file will have to be added and committed as usual. </p>
      		<p> Along the way the command <kbd>git status</kbd> can be helpful (or confusing&hellip;).
      			Git status always tells you what have been changed and what needs to be done. </p>
      		<p> If you don&rsquo;t want the branch in your working tree you can delete it with
      			<kbd>git branch -d &lt;branchname&gt;</kbd>, but normally this is only done with small,
      			short lived local branches. </p>
      		<p> Note: As branches are cheap to make and delete the small, short lived branches absolutely
      			has a use for trying out new stuff without risking wrecking the master branch. </p>

      		<h3>Rebase</h3>
      		<p> Instead of merge that leaves branches, it is possible to rewind time to where the branch started
      			and then commit to the master branch as if the branch was never created. </p>
      		<p> This is done with the command <kbd>rebase</kbd> and it leaves the commit tree a little cleaner. </p>
      		<p> Read more at
      		<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing">https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing</a> </p>

      		<p> To rebase a branch back into <em>master</em> go to the branch with </p>
      		<p align="center"> <kbd>gi</kbd><kbd>t branch </kbd><kbd>&lt;</kbd><kbd>branchname</kbd><kbd>&gt;</kbd> </p>
      		<p>and then write</p>
      		<p align="center"> <kbd>git rebase master</kbd>. </p>
      		<p>As the branch typically will be a commit or two ahead of <em>master</em> you now go back to master </p>
      		<p align="center"> <kbd>git checkout master</kbd> </p>
      		<p> and do a fast-forward merge to get <em>master</em> up to speed </p>
      		<p align="center"> <kbd>git merge &lt;branchname&gt;</kbd> </p>
      		<p align="left" > To delete a branch simply type </p>
      		<p align="center"> <kbd>git branch -d &lt;branchname&gt;</kbd> </p>

      		<h3>Github</h3>
      		<p> Git is meant to preserve your work and make going back to earlier versions easy, but also
      			to facilitate working together with others. </p>
      		<p> Therefore it is easy to share a common repository in the cloud. Here I will use
            Github as an example. </p>
      		<p> If you don&rsquo;t have a Github account start by getting one. </p>
          <p> After Github has started to use 2FA you need an app on your phone and you need to generate a token
            for each new computer you work on. <br>
            The token can be thought of as an autogenerated password. <br>
            Tokens can be generated (and revoked) at your Github page by clicking on your avatar, choose <em>Settings, Developer
              settings, Personal acces token, Generate new token</em>. (Tip: Name the token after the computer you will use it on) <br>
              You use the copied token when Git asks for at password. After that Git should store
              the acces credentials and you can forget about the long string of numbers and letters. <br>
              If you decide to store the token on your computer, you should encrypt it. <br>
              Personally I don't bother. It is releatively easy to generate a new token. </p>

      		<p> If you have a local repository on your computer you want to share or backup in the cloud, you start
      			with making a new repository at Github with the name of your project &ndash; but do <em>not</em> add a
      			Read.me or license. </p>

      		<p> Once the Github repository is up click the green <em>Clone or download</em>-button
            and copy the url. </p>
      		<p> In your terminal you can bind your local repository to the one on Github by typing </p>
      		<p align="center"> <kbd>git remote add origin https://github.com/someuser/hello_world.git</kbd> </p>
      		<p> and then push your work to Github by issuing the command </p>
      		<p align="center"> <kbd>git push origin master</kbd> </p>

      		<p> To get updates from Github use <kbd>git fetch, git merge</kbd> </p>

      		<p align="left" > Or better: set the local master to follow the master on Github by writing </p>
      		<p align="center"> <kbd>git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master</kbd> </p>
      		<p align="left" > After that you can get updates by simply write <kbd>git pull</kbd> </p>
      		<p> This will also make <kbd>git push</kbd> the equivalent of <kbd>git push origin master</kbd> if things are set
      			up correctly. </p>
      		<p> Search the net for what to do it if <kbd>git push</kbd> and <kbd>git pull</kbd> does not work. </p>

      		<p align="left"> If you want to clone an existing Github repository onto your
            computer use the green <em>Code</em>- button on the Github page
            to copy the url and go to the folder where you intend the project to live and type </p>
      		<p align="center"> <kbd>git clone https://github.com/someuser/hello_world.git</kbd>.</p>
          <p>  A folder named hello_world containing all files from the project will then be created. </p>
          <p> <em>NOTE:</em> Copying the address from github using ctrl+c and pasting with ctrl+v can
            introduce a hidden character before https. If you get this error <i>git cloning fatal: protocol 'https'
            is not supported</i> try deleting the h and the blank spaces to the left and then rewrite blank space and h </p>

      		<p align="left" > Then go to the project folder with <kbd>cd hello_world</kbd>
            and start programming. </p>

      		<h3>Deliberate learning</h3>
      		<p> Make a dummy project to experiment on and revisit your skills regularly. </p>

      		<p> ToDo: make a Github project with branches to clone and experiment on. </p>
      		<br>
      		<h3>Various loose ends</h3>

      		<p>Show branches on remote: <kbd>git remote show origin</kbd>
      		</p>

      		<p>
      			Delete branch on remote (<em>Careful!</em>): <kbd>git push --delete origin &lt;Filename&gt;</kbd>
