          <p> My name is Mads Horn (cis male, pronouns <em>he, him, his</em>) and I trained as an astronomer in Aarhus in 1991. </p>
          <p>From 1991 to 2016, I taught physics and math at high school level (STX and HTX), but
            I got sick from stress and currently live of a disability pension from my pension fund.</p>
          <p>I have always programmed as a hobby, but in 2017 I started in earnest learning
            programming via self study. First with my youngest and later alone.</p>
          <p>I have looked into Python, Rust and HTML / CSS / JavaScript and jQuery.</p>
          <p>Cooking is another big interest of mine and on this website I am going to
            put cookbooks and programs that I write.</p>
          <p>Open source is close to my heart, so stuff I post here has an un-license
            on it. That means you can share and steal as much as you want. </p>
          <p>Information wants to be free! :-)</p>
